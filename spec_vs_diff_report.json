  "summary": "The diff shows that CubeVisualization.tsx was modified and contains the new FBM-based nebula fragmentShader with the correct color palette (c1=blue, c2=pink, c3=purple, c4=near-black), blackMask via smoothstep, and gamma-corrected output. The file summary confirms the fragmentShader was updated as required. Two other files were also modified: frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json — these are metadata/state tracking files, not backend or other frontend source files, so they are borderline but likely acceptable as internal tooling artifacts.",
