  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented in the shown LandModel.tsx traversal (biome-specific emissiveIntensity set before persisting baseEmissive; dithering enabled on all processed materials). REQ-2 (useFrame pulse logic using group.current.traverse and scaling emissiveIntensity = baseEmissive * pulse) is not evidenced in the truncated diff. The diff also includes modifications outside LandModel.tsx, which were not requested and conflict with the scope constraint.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Refine the emissive pulse in LandModel.tsx so the useFrame loop uses group.current.traverse(...) and sets material.emissiveIntensity = material.userData.baseEmissive * pulse for meshes with baseEmissive defined.",
      "reason": "The provided LandModel.tsx diff excerpt shows material setup and baseline storage, but does not show any useFrame implementation or group.current.traverse-based pulsing logic due to truncation; therefore implementation cannot be verified from the evidence.",
