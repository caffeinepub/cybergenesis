  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 are largely implemented (Canvas renderer calibration, lighting balance, key light camera-sync, LandModel updateMatrixWorld+Box3 safety, guarded traversal, glow list emissive behavior, and envMapIntensity rules). However, REQ-1’s HemisphereLight uses `color` instead of the explicitly-required `skyColor` prop. Additionally, several unrelated/non-requested files appear to have been changed/added, violating the “strictly limited changes” constraint and immutable-path constraint.",
