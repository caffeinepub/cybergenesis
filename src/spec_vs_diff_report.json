  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) are fully implemented in the diff. REQ-1 correctly sets Artist Workshop HDRI with environmentIntensity=1.0 and blur=0. REQ-2 implements the complete biome-specific lighting configuration object with all 7 entries and applies it in the traverse loop. REQ-3 updates the pulse animation formula and applies it in the useFrame hook with proper conditional logic for emissive materials only.",
