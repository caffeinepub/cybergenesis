  "summary": "Diff evidence confirms REQ-5 (LandModel baseEmissive=2.2 when emissiveMap exists) and partially confirms REQ-3 (KeyLightSync intensity updated). The diff does not provide evidence for the required Canvas-level `dithering: true`, toneMappingExposure change, hemisphereLight intensity change, or UnrealBloomPass threshold/luminanceSmoothing updates. Additionally, LandModel introduces material-level dithering, which was not requested and violates the stated constraint to only change the baseEmissive numeric value in that file.",

      "reason": "The truncated diff excerpt for `CubeVisualization.tsx` does not include the `onCreated` handler, so there is no direct evidence the assignment was made.",

      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show the UnrealBloomPass instantiation or any `threshold`/`luminanceSmoothing` assignments, so the numeric updates cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
