      "reason": "The diff excerpt for `frontend/src/components/CubeVisualization.tsx` is truncated before the Canvas `onCreated` handler (or any renderer configuration) is shown, so there is no direct evidence that `gl.toneMappingExposure` remains explicitly set to `0.6` and is not overridden elsewhere in the file.",
