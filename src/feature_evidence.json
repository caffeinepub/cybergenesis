      "featureTitle": "Update `frontend/src/components/LandModel.tsx` emissive material logic so emissive glow is conditional: if a mesh/material has an `emissiveMap`, keep it and set emissive color to white with `m.userData.baseEmissive = 2.0`; otherwise disable emissive completely by setting emissive to black and `m.userData.baseEmissive = 0.0` (to prevent models without emissive maps from glowing white). Replace only the current emissive block in the material loop, keeping all other behavior unchanged.",
