      "featureTitle": "In frontend/src/components/CubeVisualization.tsx, implement Bloom using native Three.js examples modules (EffectComposer + RenderPass + UnrealBloomPass from three/examples/jsm) instead of any @react-three/postprocessing-based solution. Use a 50% internal resolution for the UnrealBloomPass (new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2)) for performance. Calibrate Bloom to threshold=1.1, strength=0.35, radius=0.35. Keep renderer toneMappingExposure synced to 0.6 (do not change existing tone mapping/output color space configuration). Integrate composer rendering so the scene is rendered via composer.render (i.e., composer output replaces direct gl.render) and manage the composer lifecycle with React hooks; add unmount cleanup that calls dispose() on composer, renderPass, and bloomPass. Do not change any existing light settings or other V.10.1.PBR calibration in this component beyond adding/removing Bloom-related code.",
