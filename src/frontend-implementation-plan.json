      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "`CubeVisualization.tsx` fragment shader contains the user-provided `void main()` block exactly, replacing the previous `void main()` implementation in `BackgroundSphere`.",
        "The fragment shader no longer references or uses `edgeMask` (or equivalent masking) in `void main()`.",
        "When rendering, the background nebula visually covers the full inside of the radius-300 sphere without a circular border/vignette that makes it look like a smaller sphere.",
        "The background sphere continues to animate over time via `uTime` (no regression in uniform updates or animation loop)."
